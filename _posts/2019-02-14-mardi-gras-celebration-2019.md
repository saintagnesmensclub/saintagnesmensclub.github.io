title: Mardi Gras Celebration 2019

The **5th Annual St. Agnes Men's Mardi Gras Event** will be held on **Tuesday, March 5, at 7:00 p.m. in Schuler Hall**. There will be a Rosary at 6:30 pm in the chapel that you are all invited to attend as well. There will also be a brief religious talk prior to the starting of the event. Please mark your calendars. We've had an excellent turnout the past several years, and I hope each of you is able to come this year. It's a great way to meet others in the parish and have one last hurrah before Lent begins. 

Peter Dahdah will again be making his legendary gyros. We will have Scotch and whiskey, in addition to the customary beer and cigars, for those so inclined. The cost will be $20 for food and drink, or $25 for food, drink, and cigar. 

We will have a free poker tournament (Texas Hold 'Em) starting at 7:45 p.m.

Please [click here to email](mailto:st.agnes.mens.club@gmail.com) and let us know if you will be attending. This is by no means meant to be exclusive. Please extend an invitation to anyone you think might be interested in coming.
