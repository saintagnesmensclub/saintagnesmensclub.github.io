The Men's Club Christmas Party is coming up on Wednesday, January 16. It begins with a social hour at 6:00 PM, followed by dinner at 7:00. Bring your favorite beverage and a side dish to share.

There is another event going on in Schuler Hall, so the party will be in the Bride's Room and the Archive Room.
